	<h1>Action list for Net Neutrality</h1>
	
	<p>Net neutrality is all about keeping the Internet from becoming a carrier-controlled replcia of cable TV.
    Yes, there will be innovative bundles and tempting new pricing models, but the bottom line is that the open garden
    will get a wall.  And the money the large-scale sites pay carriers to break through that wall ultimately comes from you.<br><br>
    We can do better.  We can make the Internet available to all and keep open delivery of bits out of the hands of the ISPs (Internet providers.)<br><br>
    Here's how to help. You can call, you can write, and you can get friends to 
    join in.  The upcoming decision is only the start.  We can win this one!</p>
	</p>
	<h2>What we propose</h2>
	<p>Specifically, we propose that priority channels and sites who presence is controlled by your cable or wireless Internet 
		provider can co-exist with the open 
	Internet as long as both are developed simulataneously.  We cannot let the Internet wither to make room for 
		clever new billing plans.
Therefore, if you increase the capcity of the tollways into your home/life 
		you have to make the same capacity increase to the open Internet path.  </p>
	<p>In addition, we propose 
	that access fees for commercial and consumer users increase progressively in proportion to access speed.  
	This progressive charge means the large services pay more and slower consumers get a discount.  
		The progressive, larger charges for very high speed, typically streaming providers, 
		underwrites universal access for everyone else.  It could even subsidize devices.</p>
	<p>Note that this helps the small innovator, since their rates are reduced until they are highly successful</p>
